## General settings

You can add a description to this config for documentation or notes. Office Tool Plus supports displaying markdown-formatted text, and this content is shown to the user before deploying Office.

## Install settings

### Office version

If you need to install a historical version of Office, you can select an available historical version from the drop-down list. Also you can get the historical version from [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdates/update-history-microsoft365-apps-by-date). If the drop-down list is empty, it may be that your Internet connection has failed, or that the update channel you have selected does not have any available historical versions.

If you have downloaded Office installation files, the versions of all Office installation files under the appropriate channel are shown here.

### Source path

If you have Office installation files, you should select them on [Installation files](/deploy/settings/basic.md#installation-files) panel, instead of writing the path here.

## Activation settings

The activation settings are intended to be used by IT administrators only, and should not be changed by individual users.

## Application preferences
