## Windows end of support and Microsoft 365 Apps

Microsoft 365 Apps may not install or run correctly on older systems. Microsoft strongly recommend you move to a supported operating system for better experience.

If you still want to install Microsoft 365 Apps on your PC, please use ***Current Channel*** as deploy channel. If you receive a message that your operating system is not supported when installing Microsoft 365 Apps, you can try changing the installation module from `Office Deployment Tool` to `Office Tool Plus` to skip the compatibility check.
