## Application launcher

In homepage, you can launch any installed Office apps, or view the related websites.

When an Office application is installed, clicking the corresponding item will launch the corresponding application. For example, clicking on Word will launch the Word application, or if Word is not installed, it will launch the web version of Word.

Some items may launch the Microsoft Store after clicking, such as Power BI or To Do, and you can install these programs through the Store. After installation, press F5 to refresh the data or restart Office Tool Plus, and clicking the corresponding item will launch the application.

You can open the web version of these items through the context menu, or create a desktop shortcut. When the application is available, a shortcut to the application will be created, otherwise a web link shortcut will be created.
